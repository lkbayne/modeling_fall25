# Monterey Bay Climate Change and Nutrient Dynamics

## Project Overview
This project investigates the effects of **decreased upwelling winds** on nutrient concentrations in **Monterey Bay, California**, under climate change scenarios.

### Research Question
**How will climate change affect nutrient concentration in Monterey Bay given the projected decrease in upwelling winds?**

---

## Experimental Design

### Model Setup
I will construct a regional ocean model spanning **Monterey Bay and the area just outside the bay**, and run the model for **one year (2008)** â€” a year of strong upwelling according to the **BEUTI Index**.

Two simulations will be performed:

1. **Normal Conditions Run**  
   - Baseline wind and sea surface height (SSH) conditions.  

2. **Decreased Upwelling Run**  
   - Reduced upwelling-favorable winds and increased SSH to simulate climate change impacts.

---

## Hypothesis
It is anticipated that **decreased winds and higher sea surface height** will reduce the intensity of coastal upwelling, leading to:
- Weaker vertical transport of cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface.  
- Lower nutrient fluxes and surface nutrient concentrations in Monterey Bay.

## Forcing and Initial Conditions
- **Initial Conditions:** State of the **ECCO Version 5 Model** in **January 2008**.  
- **Boundary and External Forcing:** Derived from **ECCO Version 5 output** for 2008.  

---

## Analysis and Visualization
- Create a **time series** of nutrient concentrations in the Monterey Bay region for both model runs.  
- Compare nutrient differences through time between the two simulations.  
- Produce a **movie visualization** showing nutrient differences between the model with normal conditions and the model with decreased winds and higher SSH.

## Expected Outcomes
This study will help quantify how projected decreases in upwelling-favorable winds under climate change scenarios may influence nutrient supply and productivity in Monterey Bay.
