# Monterey Bay Climate Change and Nutrient Dynamics

## Project Overview
This project investigates how decreased upwelling winds and increase sea surface temperature, expected under future climate change, may affect nutrient concentrations dynamics in Monterey Bay, California.

## Research Question
How will climate change affect nutrient concentration in Monterey Bay given the projected decrease in upwelling winds and increase in sea surface temperature (SST)?

## Model Experiments
To investigate this question, I will construct a regional ocean model spanning Monterey Bay and the surrounding offshore region. The model will simulate one year (2008), which is a year of strong upwelling as shown by the BEUTI Index.

Two simulations will be performed:
1. **Normal Conditions Run** – baseline wind, temperature, and sea surface height (SSH) conditions.  
2. **Decreased Upwelling Run** – reduced upwelling-favorable winds and increased SST represent climate change effects.

The second simulation will test whether weaker upwelling and warmer surface waters reduce nutrient supply and potentially promote more frequent or intense HAB events.

## Hypothesis
Decreased winds, higher SST, and increased SSH will weaken upwelling, resulting in reduced transport of cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface, lower nutrient fluxes, and conditions that may favor HAB development.

## Model Setup
- **Model domain:** Monterey Bay and adjacent coastal ocean  
- **Simulation period:** January–December 2008  
- **Initial conditions:** ECCO Version 5 (January 2008)  
- **Boundary and forcing:** Derived from ECCO Version 5 output  
- **Perturbations:** decreased winds, increased SST, increased SSH  

## Analysis
- Create time series of nutrient concentrations for both model runs.  
- Compare differences in nutrient levels and fluxes between simulations.  
- Visualize changes with maps and a short movie showing nutrient differences over time.  

## Expected Outcome
This study will help quantify how reduced upwelling and ocean warming may alter nutrient supply and increase the potential for harmful algal blooms in Monterey Bay.
