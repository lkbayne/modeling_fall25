# Monterey Bay Upwelling Nutrient Dynamics

## Project Overview
This project investigates how winds impact upwelling and affect nutrient concentrations dynamics in Monterey Bay, California.

## Research Question
How does wind strenght impact upwelling and nutrient concentration dynamics in Monterey Bay?

## Model Experiments
To investigate this question, I will construct a regional ocean model spanning Monterey Bay and the surrounding offshore region. The model will simulate one year (2008), which is a year of strong upwelling as shown by the BEUTI Index.

Two simulations will be performed:
1. **Normal Conditions Run** – baseline wind conditions.  
2. **Decreased Upwelling Run** – reduced upwelling-favorable winds.

## Hypothesis
Decreased winds will weaken upwelling, resulting in reduced transport of cold, nutrient-rich water to the surface, lower nutrient fluxes, and conditions that may favor HAB development.

## Model Setup
- **Model domain:** Monterey Bay and adjacent coastal ocean  
- **Simulation period:** January–December 2008  
- **Initial conditions:** ECCO Version 5 (January 2008)  
- **Boundary and forcing:** Derived from ECCO Version 5 output  
- **Perturbations:** decreased winds 

## Analysis
- Create time series of nutrient concentrations for both model runs.  
- Compare differences in nutrient levels and fluxes between simulations.  
- Visualize changes with maps and a short movie showing nutrient differences over time.  

## Expected Outcome
This study will help quantify how reduced upwelling may alter nutrient supply and increase the potential for harmful algal blooms in Monterey Bay.
